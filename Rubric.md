| Part I | Student did not successfully implement a working algorithm from the list of possible data science algorithms. | Student successfully implemented a working algorithm from the list of possible data science algorithms. Their code may not be the most easy to understand for someone else trying to read through it. | Student successfully implemented a working algorithm from the list of possible data science algorithms. Their code is structured and organized in such a way that it's straightforward for someone else to read and understand. |
| Part II | Student either did not present on their work during the week or did not present in a satisfactory manner. | Student presented on their work and talked about their progress over the week in a clear manner. Their presentation might not have been the most approachable for someone who doesn't have any sort of data science background. | Student presented on their work and did so in such a way that it was easy for someone who doesn't have any data science background to grasp. |
