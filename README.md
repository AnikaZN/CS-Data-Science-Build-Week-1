# CS Build Week I for Data Science Students

For your first CS Build Week, you'll be implementing a few watershed algorithms that are very often used in the data science world. You've probably heard of these algorithms before. You might even have an idea of how they work. But to really solidify your understanding of them, you're going to implement them and then use your implementation just like how you would if you'd imported the algorithm from a data science or machine learning library.

## Deliverables

### Part I

For the first part of this Build Week project, you'll pick one of the following algorithms to implement:

- [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
- [Decision Tree Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
- [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
- [DBSCAN Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)

Your algorithm, implemented as a Python class, should have the following methods: `fit` and `predict`. You are only allowed to use base Python, `numpy`, and `scipy` to implement your algorithm of choice. You may reference any outside materials that you need, but copying and pasting another open-source implementation is strictly prohibited.

You'll then use your implementation on an appropriate set of data and compare the results that you got from your implementation against the results yielded by the versions in the [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

### Part II

For the second part of this Build Week project, you'll be presenting your findings and results from this week to the cohort. Some things you may want to talk about in this presentation include, but are not limited to:

- Teach the algorithm to the rest of the cohort, which will include many people who have very little clue about what data science even is.
- Share your blockers, triumphs, and what you learned over the course of the week developing the algorithm you chose. 
- Talk about the differences (or perhaps lack thereof) in the results you saw in comparing your own implementation against the sklearn implementation of the same algorithm. What might have caused some of the discrepancies? 

### Stretch Goal

- Write up a blog post of your presentation and post it!
